# My Practice Portfolio

## Description

For this project, we were tasked with building a web portfolio from scratch that could function on a variety of screen sizes (for the purposes of this project, the sizes tested were widths of 992px, 768px, and 400px). This portfolio would consist of three different pages:
* An About Me/Homepage (with a short bio written to wrap around a small image)
* A Contact page (with a contact form so users could message the site owner)
* A Portfolio page (with 5 thumbnails, each representing a piece of one's portfolio)

Within each of these separate pages, there was also meant to be a Navigation bar and footer. All of these elements were meant to be responsive so that the same code worked naturally at each of the required sizes. To accomplish this, I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework and their extensive (and helpful) grid system. To fill out the site, I supplied my own bio for the homepage. Since my portfolio as a programmer is rather limited at this point, I instead included photos of me and several dogs.

## Usage

In the smaller sized pages, the items in the navbar can be found under the toggle button in the top right corner. As well, the name in the top-left can also navigate you to the 'About Me' index page from any of the other pages.

Here are the three pages built, each in a different size.

The 'Portfolio' page at a width of 400px.
